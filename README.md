# Zelda Adventure Game
This is a Java game I made back in my 2013-2014 school year at Royal West for my comp sci class.
It's based off of The Legend of Zelda, using similar sprites and game mechanics.

# How to play?
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the game folder in termianl or use something like BluJ and add a project.
3. Run zelda.java.
4. Enjoy!

## Note
I made this game way before my knowledge of programming was at all developed, and so my code is extremely messy and all in one file (I know, terrible).

I've also forgotten half the things I did to make the game work, so editing it to clean it up is a no-go. However, the game served its purpose as a learning project for me.

There may be some minor bugs in the game (I'm aware of a bug concerning the hardest difficulty, but reaching that point is nigh impossible unless you're a gaming prodigy).
